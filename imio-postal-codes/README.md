# imio-postal-codes

## Tired of using google
I was tired of not remembering the postal codes which I need during
the day at work.
I found that wallonie.be offer a geoservices API where postal codes
can be recolted.

## The postal codes in the terminal
Now I don't have to use Google anymore.
I can make that script executable globaly and use it
to remember the postal codes when needed.

You can test it using the example below.

#### How to use (example):

`python3 03-get-cps-by-commune.py arlon`

##### result :
```
imac2020@iMac imio-postal-codes % python3 03-get-cps-by-commune.py charleroi                  
[[6030], [6001], [6031], [6061], [6000], [6010], [6020], [6060], [6041], [6030], [6040], [6042], [6032], [6043], [6044]]
```

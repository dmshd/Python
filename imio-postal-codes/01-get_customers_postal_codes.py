# The general idea is to make an easy and faster way to get a postal code of one of our client
# 1. Query http://geoservices.wallonie.be/geolocalisation/rest/searchLocalites/namur   (namur for example) 
#    for each of client I can get through infra-api 
# 2. Write these data in a JSON object
# 3. Make an API that return just what I need 
#    maybe with fastapi - https://calmcode.io/fastapi/hello-world.html
